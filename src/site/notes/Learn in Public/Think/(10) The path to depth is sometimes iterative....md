> The path to depth is sometimes iterative and not the result of major leaps. I call that the Good Life Algorithm
- @Cal Newport [youtube video [[2025-05-30\|2025-05-30]]]

[**example**:: [[Career Capital Pathway Map\|The Life]]] you want is [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity\|built brick by brick]], or painted stroke by stroke. [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(5A2A) Take Small Visible Actions\|Moving in the desired or optimal direction]]] consistently can be more important than making leaps and bounds toward a destination that unknowingly may not be what you want.

Each decision you make shifts you into a different multiverse. You don't know which decision and which action will land you in the "right" one, but by iterative movement you unlock different options or 'timelines.' 

Interestingly, Evelyn, by virtue of picking every 'bad' decision, has retained access to the most number of parallel Life options. But while useful for the movie, that access only goes one day (past), which unless we have access to a device that let's you step into parallel universes, is not useful.

So instead, we should be thinking about how the decisions we make and the actions we take can open up the most "parallel universes" in which we live rich, beautiful lives.
