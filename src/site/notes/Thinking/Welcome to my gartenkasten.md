# Kia ora, e hoa! 
> _Welcome, friend_: Start here to explore the garden of ideas

## Welcome to my gartenkasten 🌱🗃️

I'm **Pat Oyson-Matthan**, and this digital space is where I bravely attempt to [[]]: by sharing ideas and exploring what delights and challenges me.

> Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of these two thinking and writing models! 
> - '**digital garden**' (`garten`) — 'come-as-you-are' ever-growing interconnected ideas 
> - '`zettelkasten`' (**slip/note box**) — modular, atomic, branched and interconnected ideas 

(Notice how the term is German—and I _don't_ speak it—so I've skipped the 'digital' part 😅 German, I love you for your elegant modularity)

#### Here I explore: 
- Identity
- Self-narratives
- Professional coaching 
- Systems thinking
- Mental health 
- Whimsy and cosiness as antidote to hustle culture 
- ...anything else that tickles my fancy!

### Start Here 

Much like a cottage garden, this space is messy, magical, and you never know what will pop up next. 

If you're curious about **what even is this**, please start here: 
- What is a [[]]?
- What is a [[Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]?
- [[]]
- [[]]
- [[How to navigate the gartenkasten\|How to navigate the gartenkasten]]

**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts.** 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life—and cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

> _By the way,_ **[[pink links\|pink links]]** mean the note is _unpublished_ or _private_ OR they mean it's an external link (not sure how to make the distinction clear atm), while **[[Thinking/Welcome to my gartenkasten\|green links]]** are public, and you can view them.

### Established plants — explore ideas from here

I'm trying to weave the connections between ideas as deftly as I can. These connections might be explicit (hard-coded in a structured list or in an essay) or contextual (hyperlinked as ontologically related). 

Below are hotspots that make **interesting starting points** for exploring this gartenkasten. Some are short and atomic `zettel`-style, while others are longform evergreen essays.
