A [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1A3) Digital garden\|(1A1A1A3) Digital garden]]] is oppositional to the concept of blogging, where ideas are static and chronological; when ideas change in blogs, we publish new blogs and make a note in the old posts saying "This is old, go to the new version". 

Meanwhile in a digital garden, the idea plants continue to evolve and grow. Maturation and stagnation are often explicitly described in digital gardens (saplings, plants, trees & the idea of levels vs living plants vs stones)
