I previously thought about the [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A4) Zettel as micro-essay\|(1A4) Zettel as micro-essay]]], but now I see that I was thinking about two different kinds of notes. Since I see the [[Zettelkasten as conversation partner\|Zettelkasten as conversation partner]], it makes sense that I have shaped the conversation to suit my needs and thinking style. 

These are the different notes in my [**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Welcome to Pat's gartenkasten\|Gartenkasten]]]: 

| Type           | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Location            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ✨ Spark        | **Fleeting note**, which is an unprocessed thought that may have sparked randomly<br><br>_Sparks come and go, maybe they magically turn into plants and leaves_                                                | /                   |

| 🍃 Cutting (1) | **Atomic note**, which describes a singular, modular idea in my own words, ideally including a reference to the seed. <br><br>_A single cutting is complete for propagating new plants, i.e. modular, atomic._ | /Thinking/Zettels   |
| 🌿  Plant (2)  | **Micro-essay** note, which synthesises related atomic ideas. To be transformed into separate cuttings.<br><br>_A hearty plant that will be turned into many plants_                                           | /Thinking/Zettels   |
| 🌳 Tree (3)    | **Longer-form reflection** note, which incorporates many ideas. <br><br>_The many plants combined into a tree—I know that's not how trees work, shhh it's ok_                                                  |                     |
| 🪻 Flower      | **Visual note** → An idea expressed as a visual: charts, doodles, or diagrammed thinking. <br><br>_An idea that has bloomed as a visual_                                                                       | /Thinking/Zettels   |
| 🦋 Butterfly   | **Reflection note** → Notes on self-reflection, self-storying, and transformation, personal takes, memories, queries. <br><br>_Butterfly as metamorphosis._                                                    | /Thinking           |
| 🪵 Log         | **Creative output**, like a longer-form piece, shipped project, or polished output. <br><br>_The mature tree, now harvested and logged._                                                                       | /Thinking/          |
| 🚩Signpost     | **Hub/Structure Note** which signals direction, clusters concepts, guides further exploration. <br><br>_Like a signpost in a garden._                                                                          | /Thinking           |
